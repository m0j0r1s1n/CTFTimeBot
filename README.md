# CTFTimeBot
A bot I built based of the NULL CTF Bot.  Basically it helps list upcoming CTF's and allows for CTF roles/challenges/solves and creation/deletion commands to be issued in your Discord server.  Enjoy and feel free to PR and also tweak to suit.
The bot where ever it may be run should be used in a python virtual enviroment make sure to install requirements.txt - it wont work otherwise.
Take heed not to post a Discord token when testing and use the safe option by creating a file `.env` and having your Discord token in this as `DISCORD_TOKEN=<token>` .

## Example

`!help_ctftime`

`!time_until_start <event ID>`

Feel free to change commands to suit your lingo - I'm sure I will.

Kudos to Co-Pilot for stopping me go mad at syntax error stuff, I guess AI ain't that bad.

Enjoy - happy CTF'ing
